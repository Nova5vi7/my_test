            We believe that small can be big
          </h3>

            Sparkinity was born because we believe in innovation. Data shows
            that small stores are better positioned than ever to take on retail
            giants as consumers increasingly seek curation and a personalised
            touch. Agility is a powerful weapon and we seek to empower the
            agile. ​But to fulfil our vision we need to disrupt the age old
            system of distribution & wholesale. Our founding team has personal
            experiences & understanding of the expenses incurred , time and
            incredible effort that both buyers & makers make to connect. All
            because of the need to get a physical glimpse of that unicorn called
            the bestseller before risking an order. ​We are changing the buying
            process by providing retailers a medium to order online with free
            returns. Makers save on huge upfront costs for creating distribution
            networks & store owners can easily let their customers decide
            without taking on the risks involved with buying decisions.
